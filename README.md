Deliver SVG-notation from a couple of Opensource Software products

AsSVG may best be described as a couple of efforts to enable and thus promote the use of SVG in Open Source GIS software. It started with a function to deliver SVG-notation from PostgreSQL with PostGIS called AsSVG() back in 2005 which was added to PostGIS 0.9. In spring 2008 v.out.svg was included in GRASS GIS 6.3 and in July 2009 PostGIS's AsSVG() function has been ported to Spatialite 2.3.1, an extension that enables spatial data support in SQLite. Besides that there's a simple AsSVG-ArcGIS Geoprocessing script that allows to export ArcGIS Point-, Line- or Polygon layers to SVG circle, text or path notation.
